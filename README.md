### Create Project Using Jumble

A project can be created using `Jumble` as a base. There is an `archetype` within the `Jumble` project to do this.

To do this the archetype need to be installed first. Use following steps to install the archetype.
```bash
    cd <base_project_dir>/archetype

    mvn clean install
```

Once the archetype is installed it can be used to create new projects. Use following steps to do so.

- Go to the directory that you need to create the new project in
- Run following command
```bash
    mvn archetype:generate
```
- This will give an interactive mode to work with
